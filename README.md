# What is this?

Turing proposed a test, known as the Turing Test, to determine whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In the test, a human judge interacts with both a machine and a human without knowing which is which. If the judge cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is considered to have passed the test.



## Explanation

My application is a web-based chat application designed to teach the Turing test. The responses provided are analyzed at the end of the program and recorded in the database. I used WebSocket as the communication protocol.
